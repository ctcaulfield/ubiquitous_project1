Group Project 1 - Devices for Sharing
Christopher Caulfield, Mary Rose Weber
Game - Rock, Paper, Scissors

Problem: 

We wanted to create a way to play the traditional game of rock, paper, scissors but to prevent there being communication issues between the players. Some think you say: “Rock, paper, scissors” then display your selection, while others do “Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!”. Allowing for the server to monitor the game - it allows the participants to enjoy the game stress free.

Design Process:

index.html - contains the interface showing devices in the game, score, and countdown.
main.js - adds more dynamic functionality to index.html, gets information from the device via server.js 
server.js - all server communication between the device and the ui
node_modules - nodejs package
RPS.ino - code for bean device and uses a method to communicate messages with server.js

Challenges:

Applying the dynamic features into index.html based on communication with the beans was difficult. In addition, connecting multiple devices took a couple hours to figure out.
